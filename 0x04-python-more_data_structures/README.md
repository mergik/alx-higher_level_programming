## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project explores the use of sets and dictionaries in Python, focusing on their properties and methods. It covers operations like addition, removal, and membership testing.

Key concepts covered in this project include:
- Creating and manipulating sets
- Using set methods and functions
- Understanding set operations like union, intersection, and difference
- Working with dictionaries
