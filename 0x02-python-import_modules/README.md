## 0x02. Python - import & modules
This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of imports and modules in Python. The project aims to familiarize students with importing functions, creating modules, and using command-line arguments in Python programming.

Key concepts covered in this project include:
- Importing functions from other files
- Creating and using modules
- Handling command-line arguments
- Using built-in functions like `dir()`
- Understanding variable scope and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` idiom

The scripts in this directory showcase various operations such as basic arithmetic, working with command-line arguments, discovering names in a module, and implementing a simple calculator. They also demonstrate different ways of importing functions and modules, as well as some advanced Python techniques.

This project builds upon basic Python knowledge and introduces more advanced concepts related to structuring and organizing code across multiple files.
