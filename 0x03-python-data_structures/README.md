# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project focuses on the use of lists and tuples in Python, exploring their properties and methods. It covers basic operations, list comprehensions, and tuple unpacking.

Key concepts covered in this project include:
- Creating and manipulating lists
- Accessing elements in a list
- Using list methods and functions
- Understanding list slicing
- Working with tuples
