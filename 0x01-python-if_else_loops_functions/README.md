## 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. The project aims to familiarize students with control flow, iteration, and basic function definition in Python programming.

Key concepts covered in this project include:
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for and while)
- Function definition and usage
- String manipulation
- Basic arithmetic operations

The scripts in this directory showcase various operations such as number comparison, string manipulation, printing patterns, and implementing simple algorithms. They also demonstrate how to define and use functions in Python.

This project serves as an introduction to more advanced programming concepts in Python, building upon basic syntax knowledge and introducing more complex control structures.
